    Select your preferred colors for the gradient by picking the start and end colors using color pickers. You can also adjust the gradient direction to suit your design.

-   Preview Real-Time Results:
    As you make changes to the color palette and gradient direction, the tool provides a live preview of the linear gradient. You can see how your gradient will look in real-time.

-   Copy Generated CSS:
    Once you're satisfied with the gradient you've created, simply click a button to copy the CSS code for the gradient to your clipboard. This makes it easy to use the gradient in your web projects.
